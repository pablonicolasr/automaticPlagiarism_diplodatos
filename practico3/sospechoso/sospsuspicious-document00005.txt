Nagasaki had never been subjected to large scale bombing prior to the explosion of the atomic bomb there.  On August 1st, 1945, however, a number of high explosive bombs were dropped on the city.  A few of these bombs hit in the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city.  Several of the bombs hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works and six bombs landed at the Nagasaki Medical School and Hospital, with three direct hits on buildings there.  While the damage from these few bombs were relatively small, it created considerable concern in Nagasaki and a number of people, principally school children, were evacuated to rural areas for safety, thus reducing the population in the city at the time of the atomic attack.
It was not at first apparent to even trained observers visiting the two Japanese cities which of the two bombs had been the most effective.
  Total in Nagasaki (before atomic explosion)  50,000     100.0   Blasted (not burned)                          2,652       5.3   Blasted and burned                           11,494      23.0   Blasted and/or burned                        14,146      28.3   Partially burned or blasted                   5,441      10.9   Total buildings and houses destroyed         19,587      39.2   Undamaged                                    30,413      60.8
Calculations show that the structural steel and reinforced concrete frames which survived the blast fairly close to X could not have withstood the estimated peak pressures developed against the total areas presented by the sides and roof of the buildings.  The survival of these frames is explained by the fact that they were not actually required to withstand the peak pressure because the windows were quickly knocked out and roof and siding stripped off thereby reducing total area and relieving the pressure.  While this saved the building frame, it permitted severe damage to building interior and contents, and injuries to the building occupants.  Buildings without large panel openings through which the pressure could dissipate were completely crushed, even when their frames were as strong as those which survived.
